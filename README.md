HR management system with both employee and hr access: - Features exists to manage resources of multiple organisation in relation with multiple employees, every organisation has the freedom to invite and manage their employees individually.  For backend I have used Nodejs express framework, with mongoose ORM and mongoDB database and swagger for documentation, and for Frontend I have used reactjs with redux.
